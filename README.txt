Our Android app for the Huji Hackathon 2019 Competition.
We created an application which turns pet adoption to an interactive and fun experience.
In the backend we created a database which is based on data given by non-profit organizations in Israel.

Our goal is to make pet adoption more afordable and easy for people,
and to give people a few options for pets which are "good" or "fit" their needs and abilities.
